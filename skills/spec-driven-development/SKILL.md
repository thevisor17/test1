description: Creates specs before coding. Use when starting a new project, feature, or significant change and no specification exists yet. Use when requirements are unclear, ambiguous, or only exist as a vague idea. Use when evolving a shipped spec — scoping a V1, deferring ideas to a V2 backlog, or writing a follow-up spec for a change to an existing feature.

# Spec-Driven Development

## Overview

Write a structured specification before writing any code. The spec is the shared source of truth between you and the human engineer — it defines what we're building, why, and how we'll know it's done. Code without a spec is guessing.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project or feature
- Requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
- The change touches multiple files or modules
- You're about to make an architectural decision
- The task would take more than 30 minutes to implement

**When NOT to use:** Single-line fixes, typo corrections, or changes where requirements are unambiguous and self-contained.

## The Gated Workflow

Spec-driven development has four phases. Do not advance to the next phase until the current one is validated.

```
SPECIFY ──→ PLAN ──→ TASKS ──→ IMPLEMENT
   │          │        │          │
   ▼          ▼        ▼          ▼
 Human      Human    Human      Human
 reviews    reviews  reviews    reviews
```

### Phase 1: Specify

Start with a high-level vision. Ask the human clarifying questions until requirements are concrete.

**Surface assumptions immediately.** Before writing any spec content, list what you're assuming:

```
ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:
1. This is a web application (not native mobile)
2. Authentication uses session-based cookies (not JWT)
3. The database is PostgreSQL (based on existing Prisma schema)
4. We're targeting modern browsers only (no IE11)
→ Correct me now or I'll proceed with these.
```

Don't silently fill in ambiguous requirements. The spec's entire purpose is to surface misunderstandings *before* code gets written — assumptions are the most dangerous form of misunderstanding.

**Write a spec document covering these six core areas:**

1. **Objective** — What are we building and why? Who is the user? What does success look like?

2. **Commands** — Full executable commands with flags, not just tool names.
   ```
   Build: npm run build
   Test: npm test -- --coverage
   Lint: npm run lint --fix
   Dev: npm run dev
   ```

3. **Project Structure** — Where source code lives, where tests go, where docs belong.
   ```
   src/           → Application source code
   src/components → React components
   src/lib        → Shared utilities
   tests/         → Unit and integration tests
   e2e/           → End-to-end tests
   docs/          → Documentation
   ```

4. **Code Style** — One real code snippet showing your style beats three paragraphs describing it. Include naming conventions, formatting rules, and examples of good output.

5. **Testing Strategy** — What framework, where tests live, coverage expectations, which test levels for which concerns.

6. **Boundaries** — Three-tier system:
   - **Always do:** Run tests before commits, follow naming conventions, validate inputs
   - **Ask first:** Database schema changes, adding dependencies, changing CI config
   - **Never do:** Commit secrets, edit vendor directories, remove failing tests without approval

**Spec template:**

```markdown
# Spec: [Project/Feature Name] — V[N]

## Objective
[What we're building and why. User stories or acceptance criteria.]

## Tech Stack
[Framework, language, key dependencies with versions]

## Commands
[Build, test, lint, dev — full commands]

## Project Structure
[Directory layout with descriptions]

## Code Style
[Example snippet + key conventions]

## Testing Strategy
[Framework, test locations, coverage requirements, test levels]

## Boundaries
- Always: [...]
- Ask first: [...]
- Never: [...]

## Success Criteria
[How we'll know this is done — specific, testable conditions]

## Out of Scope (Deferred)
[Ideas explicitly excluded from this version — the V2 backlog. One line each: what, and why it's deferred.]

## Open Questions
[Anything unresolved that needs human input]
```

**Reframe instructions as success criteria.** When receiving vague requirements, translate them into concrete conditions:

```
REQUIREMENT: "Make the dashboard faster"

REFRAMED SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Dashboard LCP < 2.5s on 4G connection
- Initial data load completes in < 500ms
- No layout shift during load (CLS < 0.1)
→ Are these the right targets?
```

This lets you loop, retry, and problem-solve toward a clear goal rather than guessing what "faster" means.

### Phase 2: Plan

With the validated spec, generate a technical implementation plan:

1. Identify the major components and their dependencies
2. Determine the implementation order (what must be built first)
3. Note risks and mitigation strategies
4. Identify what can be built in parallel vs. what must be sequential
5. Define verification checkpoints between phases

> Follow `planning-and-task-breakdown` for the dependency-graph mapping and vertical-slicing mechanics behind these steps; it is the canonical source. The bullets above are a lightweight summary; if they ever diverge, `planning-and-task-breakdown` takes precedence.
>
> **Output convention:** Save the plan to `tasks/plan.md` and the task list to `tasks/todo.md`, per the `/plan` command convention. Create `tasks/` if it does not exist. Downstream commands (`/build`, etc.) expect these paths.

The plan should be reviewable: the human should be able to read it and say "yes, that's the right approach" or "no, change X."

### Phase 3: Tasks

Break the plan into discrete, implementable tasks:

- Each task should be completable in a single focused session
- Each task has explicit acceptance criteria
- Each task includes a verification step (test, build, manual check)
- Tasks are ordered by dependency, not by perceived importance
- No task should require changing more than ~5 files

> Follow `planning-and-task-breakdown` for the full task-sizing and dependency-ordering mechanics; it is the canonical source. The template below is a lightweight inline form; if they ever diverge, `planning-and-task-breakdown` takes precedence.

**Task template:**
```markdown
- [ ] Task: [Description]
  - Acceptance: [What must be true when done]
  - Verify: [How to confirm — test command, build, manual check]
  - Files: [Which files will be touched]
```

### Phase 4: Implement

Execute tasks one at a time following `skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md` (`incremental-implementation`) and `skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` (`test-driven-development`). Use `skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md` (`context-engineering`) to load the right spec sections and source files at each step rather than flooding the agent with the entire spec.

## Keeping the Spec Alive

The spec is a living document, not a one-time artifact:

- **Update when decisions change** — If you discover the data model needs to change, update the spec first, then implement.
- **Update when scope changes** — Features added or cut should be reflected in the spec.
- **Commit the spec** — The spec belongs in version control alongside the code.
- **Reference the spec in PRs** — Link back to the spec section that each PR implements.

## Spec Evolution: V1 Scoping and Follow-Up Changes

A spec describes one version of the work. New ideas and post-ship changes don't expand it — they queue behind it.

### Scope each version explicitly

Label the spec with the version it describes, in the title (`# Spec: Invoice Pipeline — V1`). When a shipped delta is folded back in, bump the version — the label always states which version of the system the spec describes, and makes "that's a V2 idea" an objective call rather than a judgment made mid-build.

During Specify, ideas that won't make this version go under **Out of Scope (Deferred)** — captured, not lost. This makes the V1 boundary enforceable: during implementation, anything not in the spec's requirements is out, even if it's written in the same file under Deferred. When an idea arrives mid-build, park it in the Deferred list and keep going; re-scoping happens between versions, not during one.

### Follow-up changes get a delta spec

Once a spec has shipped, a new requirement — swapping the storage engine, replacing a manual step with OCR, promoting a deferred V2 item — gets its own small spec rather than a hand-edit of the shipped one. A delta spec covers only what changes:

```markdown
# Spec Delta: [Change Name]

## Objective
[The change and why. Which deferred item or new requirement this implements.]

## Current Behavior
[What exists today — link the relevant section of the original spec.]

## New Behavior
[What will be true after the change.]

## Success Criteria
[Specific, testable conditions — including what must NOT change.]

## Boundaries
[Only deltas from the original spec's boundaries; everything else inherits.]
```

Save it alongside the original (e.g. `SPEC-postgres-migration.md` next to `SPEC.md`) and run it through the same gated workflow: human review, then plan, tasks, implement. Downstream commands know this convention — `/build auto` accepts a root-level `SPEC-<change>.md` as the spec for a follow-up change and treats it as a planning artifact in its clean-baseline check. Keep one change per delta spec — that keeps each plan/build cycle small and reviewable.

After the change ships, fold the outcome into the original spec (per Keeping the Spec Alive) so it stays the source of truth for what exists, and mark the delta implemented. The original spec always describes the current system; delta specs describe transitions.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is simple, I don't need a spec" | Simple tasks don't need *long* specs, but they still need acceptance criteria. A two-line spec is fine. |
| "I'll write the spec after I code it" | That's documentation, not specification. The spec's value is in forcing clarity *before* code. |
| "The spec will slow us down" | A 15-minute spec prevents hours of rework. Waterfall in 15 minutes beats debugging in 15 hours. |
| "Requirements will change anyway" | That's why the spec is a living document. An outdated spec is still better than no spec. |
| "The user knows what they want" | Even clear requests have implicit assumptions. The spec surfaces those assumptions. |
| "This idea is good, I'll fold it into the current spec" | Mid-build scope growth is how V1 slips. Park it under Out of Scope (Deferred) — captured without expanding the current cycle. |
| "The feature already has a spec, I'll just edit it for the change" | A shipped spec describes what exists. A delta spec keeps the change reviewable on its own; the original gets updated after the change ships, not before. |

## Red Flags

- Starting to write code without any written requirements
- Asking "should I just start building?" before clarifying what "done" means
- Implementing features not mentioned in any spec or task list
- Making architectural decisions without documenting them
- Skipping the spec because "it's obvious what to build"
- V1 requirements growing mid-implementation as new ideas get written straight into the spec
- Changing a shipped feature with no spec for the change because "the feature already has one"

## Verification

Before proceeding to implementation, confirm:

- [ ] The spec covers all six core areas (a full spec; a delta spec covers only the areas the change affects — at minimum objective, success criteria, and boundary deltas — and inherits the rest from the original)
- [ ] The human has reviewed and approved the spec
- [ ] Success criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Boundaries (Always/Ask First/Never) are defined
- [ ] The spec is saved to a file in the repository
- [ ] Ideas cut from this version are captured under Out of Scope (Deferred), not silently dropped or silently included
- [ ] If this is a change to a shipped spec, it is a delta spec referencing the original, not a rewrite of it
